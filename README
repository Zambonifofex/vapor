Vapor is a toolkit designed to support Liquid War 7.

While truely dedicated to power the multiplayer game Liquid War 7, it
may be used to develop other games. The idea is to provide all the
components that are not directly linked to the Liquid War gameplay,
including, but not limited to, network tools, massive parallel
computation, game loops, fixed-point math arithmetics, etc.
